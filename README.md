## Features

**Open source and cross platform:** runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, all Raspberries, Odroids and possibly on other devices. Hardware accelerated and works with or without X11. It may even run on phones and tablets too.

**Full control over the UI:** you can completely change everything that is on the screen, add or remove UI elements, menu screens, whatever. Want to make it look like Kodi? Steam? Any other launcher? No problem. You can even [run your custom shader code](etc/promo/shader_demo.jpg).

**ES2 backward compatibility:** Pegasus can use EmulationStation's gamelist files, no need to invent a new set of tools.

**Features you'd expect:** Gamepad support and config. Multiple aspect ratio support. Portable mode support. Live theme reload. Visible system informations. A clock in the corner.
